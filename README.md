# PySQLDataBase
Made this as a remake to my `logindb` program. This uses an SQL server and Database to run instead of a text file. 

`logindb` can be found here -> https://github.com/Simple2006/logindb (It's a little textfile database I made)

`python -m pip install mysql-connector-python`

1. Make sure you have your MySQL server setup before running!
2. Make sure you have your database created!
3. Make sure to comment out your table initialization after initializing it once!

The code is a bit inefficient because I was trying to finish this as fast as I could and took a couple shortcuts.
